    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This Neapolitan pizza recipe has been about 3 years in the
            making. This recipe doesn't require a pizza oven because I 
            didn't gave one. However, this recipe does require that you
            put your oven has high as it can, so make sure you're
            comfortable doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a Neapolitan pizza, so it is different from the
            pizza you would find at places such as Pizza Hut, Dominoes,
            or Costco. In fact, I would say that this pizza is the
            opposite of Costco pizza.
        </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
            I use the following website for the measurements of the 
            pizza dough. In the calculator however, I like to get my
            <strong>hydration levels</strong> close to 80%. Although 
            it will be more difficult to work with, we need the higher
            hydration because our oven can't get as hot as a 
            conventional pizza oven. For <strong>size of pizza</strong>
            I use the back of a cast iron pan to cook so my pizza is 
            relatively small. Therefore, I use about a 160gram pizza size.
            The <strong>pizza style</strong> should still stay
            Neapolitan.

        <h3>Toppings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fresh Mozzerella</li>
                <li>Fresh Basil</li>
                <li>Good Can of Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <p>
                To Note, I will be referring to the window pane test. 
                In order to inspect the gluten development of the dough,
                we take a piece of the dough, stretch it out, and if it
                we can stretch it to a thinness in which we can see
                light through it, the dough is ready to use.
            </p>
            <h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
                <h4>Option 1 (24 Hour Method)</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mix together all the ingredients in container
                            <em>Make sure to hydrate all the flour</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>Cover and let sit on counter for 24 hours</li>
                    </ol>
                <h4>Option 2 (Fold Method) <em>(~1.5-2 Hours)</em></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mix together all the ingredients in bowl
                            <em>Make sure to hydrate all the flour</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>Cover with moist towl and let sit on 
                            counter for 30 min - 1 hour
                        </li>
                        <li>Open up the dough, take a side of the dough,
                            stretch it out, and fold it to the other side 
                            of the dough. Do this to all "4 sides" of
                            the dough.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cover the dough with moist towl and let
                            rest for another 30 min - 1 hour.
                        </li>
                        <li>Repeat this process until dough passes
                            window pane test
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <h4>Option 3 (Kneading Method) <em>(Time Depends
                    on Technique, Strength, and Endurance)</em></h4>
                    <p>For transparency, I rarely use this method
                        becaues for one, it's difficult, and for two,
                        it ends up taking as long or longer for me than the
                        fold method.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mix together all the ingredients in bowl
                            <em>Make sure to hydrate all the flour</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>Dump dough onto surface</li>
                        <li>Start kneading</li>
                        There are two main methods, the <strong>normal
                        kneading method</strong> (pulling the dough 
                        towards yourself and stretching it away from
                        you), and the <strong>slap and fold method</strong>
                        (slapping the dough onto the surface and then folding 
                        the dough onto itself). I typically do the 
                        slap and fold method because it's more suited 
                        for wetter doughs like the one we have.
                    </ol>

                <p>In all 3 methods, after you finish kneading, it's best
                    to let the dough rise in the refrigerator for 24 - 48
                    hours.
                </p>

        <h3>Pizza</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to the highest it can and leave
                    your stone or cast iron skillet in there while it
                    heats up. The cooking surface needs to preheat for
                    at least 1 hour.
                    <em>It's best to put another bigger pan on the
                        lowest rack to pick up any possible particles
                        of flour or any other bits from the pizza
                    </em>
                </li>
                <li>Remove the tomatoes from the can and discard the
                    can juices
                </li>
                <li>Blend the tomatoes (if you prefer a more uniform
                    sauce) or crush them with your hands (if you prefer
                    your suace with a bit of tomato chunks)
                </li>
                <li>Add a bit of olive oil and basil in the sauce</li>
                <li>Cut the mozzerella. You can cut them into bigger
                    slices if you prefer some bites with little cheese
                    and some bites with plenty of cheese, or smaller
                    cubes if you prefer a more uniform layer of cheese.
                </li>
                <li>Pick the basil from the stems and set aside</li>
                <li>Stretch out the pizza dough. 
                    Youtuber Alex has a good video about
                    the slap technique:

                    . Pizza chef Vito Lacopelli also has a good video
                    about dough stretching:
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4lL5I-UYbk"

                </li>
                <li>Spoon and spread the tomato sauce on the pizza</li>
                <li>Brush olive oil on the "crust" on the pizza</li>
                <li>Make sure the stone or pan is on the highest rack
                    and turn on the broil on high. We are trying to
                    recreate how pizza ovens work to the best of our ability
                </li>
                <li>Add the pizza onto the stone or pan</li>
                <li><strong>Timing</strong>
                    <p>In terms of timing, you will have to play around
                        with this yourself. I end up cooking the pizza
                        for about a 1 minute and 28 seconds. What you're
                        looking to end up with is that the crust is
                        puffed up and a contains a bit of leopard
                        spotting, which is the spots of burnt parts. In
                        addition to this, you have to figure out when to
                        add the cheese so that it melts to the way you like
                        it but it doesn't burn in when the pizza is ready.
                        I myself found that it's best to add the cheese
                        about about 45 seconds after the pizza was first
                        put in the oven, however that's just for my oven.
                        When you add the cheese, you will also add the
                        basil leaves and swirl some oil on the pizza to
                        add some fat, and to protect the basil leaves from
                        burning. Also, make sure you turn the pizza at
                        about halfway through the cooking time.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>After the pizza gets cool enough for you to not
                    absolutely burn your mouth, <strong>Eat!!</strong>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Throughout the cooking process, make sure you keep the 
                oven closed for as much as you can, with the pan or
                stone inside. if you intend to cook another pizza, 
                put the oven back to its highest temperature as soon
                as you take out the first pizza. It takes about 30
                minutes to reheat the pan, so this recipe might not be
                the best for a pizza night. (Sorry) However, I have
                found that it takes about 30 minutes for my slow self
                to prepare the next pizza, so it works out like that.
